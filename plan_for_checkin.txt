Plan for check in:

1. Literature Review:
Add some papers here
Add some medium articles here
Maybe even some gh repos

2. Dataset
what data set are we going to use?

Probably CCRL dataset?
https://lczero.org/blog/2018/09/a-standard-dataset/

3. Baseline with be minimax as depth 1?
Also we can use a very simple eval function with just counting piece weights?

4. Minimax to highest depth possible without many second slowdowns
5. For minimax- how do we learn a better eval function?
6. Metrics
Macro: Did we win the game vs lose vs draw?
Micro: How good was our move? Consult oracle (figure out where to get an oracle)

7. Future work would be neural net with supervised learning


Flynn:
 - figuring out how to not need to deep copy the board and also integrate moves into the current board position quickly.
 - This is important because one of the constraints on how deep we can go is processing time for a single move

Adhish:
 - Look into better evaluation functions
 - download stockfish

Seena:
 - Look into better evaluation functions

Prerna: Tried some evaluation functions enhancements:
1. A little more accurate piece values where bishop is slightly more valuable than knight
scoring=  {
    'p': -10,    # Black pawn
    'n': -33,    # Black knight
    'b': -38,    # Black bishop (slightly more valuable than knight)
    'r': -50,    # Black rook
    'q': -90,    # Black queen
    'k': 0,      # Black king
    'P': 10,     # White pawn
    'N': 33,     # White knight
    'B': 38,     # White bishop (slightly more valuable than knight)
    'R': 50,     # White rook
    'Q': 90,     # White queen
    'K': 0       # White king
    }

2. Evaluation function with better score if pawn is protecting the king (pawn shield) along with updated 

#Return higher positive score for shield in front of the king
def king_pawn_shield(board, king_square, is_white):
    shield_score = 0
    king_column = king_square % 8  #King Column
    king_row = king_square // 8 #Kind Row
    
    # Check left, center, right in front of the king
    for file in range(max(0, king_column - 1), min(8, king_column + 2)): #Confirming we are not going off the board while checking        
        if is_white: # For white king : check one and two ranks above as White pawns can only move upward and hence white pawns protect their king from ranks above them
            check_rows = [king_row + 1, king_row + 2] if king_row < 6 else [king_row + 1]
        else: # For black king : check one and two ranks below as Black pawns can only move downward and hence black pawns protect their king from ranks below them
            check_rows = [king_row - 1, king_row - 2] if king_row > 1 else [king_row - 1]
        
        for row in check_rows:
            if 0 <= row < 8:  # Ensuring row is on the board
                square = row * 8 + file 
                piece = board.piece_at(square)
                if piece and piece.symbol() == ('P' if is_white else 'p'):
                    shield_score += 10  # Adding points for each protecting pawn
    
    return shield_score

#simple evaluation function + King Pawn shield
def eval_board(BOARD):
    score = 0
    WHITE = True
    BLACK = False
    pieces = BOARD.piece_map()
    # pdb.set_trace()  # Set a breakpoint here
    for key in pieces:
        score += scoring[str(pieces[key])]
    
    # Adding Pawn shield evaluation to the simple evaluation function
    white_king_eval = BOARD.king(WHITE)
    black_king_eval = BOARD.king(BLACK)
    
    if white_king_eval is not None:
        score += king_pawn_shield(BOARD, white_king_eval, True)
    
    if black_king_eval is not None:
        score -= king_pawn_shield(BOARD, black_king_eval, False)
    
    return score
